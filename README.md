The main requiremenets in COVID-19 problem was to draw some animated graphs for the disease statistics. All the animated 
graphs are based on `plotly` library.

The GUI consists of three main push buttons, each one of them is responsible for a specific animated graph.
There is also two combo-boxes used to choose whether you want to see the number of infected Cases or the number of the dead ones.
